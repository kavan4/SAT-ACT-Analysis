# Problem Statement
Significant fluctuations to the participation rates and mean scores for the SAT exam have been observed. This case study summarizes the observations from data collected between 2017-2018. The report aims to make recommendations to the College Board on strategies to help improve SAT participation rates.


# Executive Summary

### Data Import & Cleaning
Before plotting and making any statements, the data needed to be cleaned up. 


### Exploratory Data Analysis
The mean, standard deviation, and max & min values of the data were calculated for each numerical variable. The highest and lowest participation rates and scores for states were identified. 

### Data Visualization
In order to help make inferences, correlation between various columns was calculated. Based on this heat maps, histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots were generated. 

### Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
Some individual variables were found to have a close-to-normal distribution. Although the data samples were more than 30,additional data would be required for a true normal distribution.

### Outside Research
A few key states were identified for further research beyond the data that was given. This was to have a deeper perspective on the trends observed.

# Conclusions and Recommendations
### Conclusions

Based on the data, a drastic change in participation rates were observed. These were attributed to the state department's education policies.
If a state were to mandate a requirement for all students to take a particular test, the participation rate for the rate would increase dramatically. 


Several states decided to cover the cost of the SAT for all their public school students. This contributed to the overall increase in SAT test-takers. Subsidies introduced for the SAT have also improved SAT participation rates. 

### Recommendations

The most significant impact on participation rates is due to College Board's collaboration with the State Departments.

Providing accessible test prep material for students would also benifit students and participation rates. The observation that states with low participation rates have the highest scores supports this.

Additional research on university admissions criteria is recommended.
